# Dung.js
**Dung.js** is a (very) work-in-progress tile engine and editor designed for creating dungeon maps. It should work with mobile devices and provide tools for editing and managing serializable dungeon maps.

## Building and running

`npm install` followed by `npm start` should be all you need to do to get everything built and running on `localhost:1234`
